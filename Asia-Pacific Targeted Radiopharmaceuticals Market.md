These two segments have distinct characteristics and contribute significantly to the overall market landscape. Targeted therapy, one of the core applications of targeted radiopharmaceuticals, focuses on the use of radioactive agents that specifically target cancer cells, offering higher precision and fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments like chemotherapy. This segment is driven by advancements in radiopharmaceutical formulations, improved imaging technologies, and the growing demand for cancer treatments with better efficacy and minimal toxicity. In the Asia-Pacific region, the adoption of targeted therapy is rapidly expanding as more healthcare facilities invest in nuclear medicine infrastructure, and as patient awareness of precision medicine grows.</p><p>Targeted diagnosis, the second major application segment, involves the use of radiopharmaceuticals in diagnostic imaging to detect diseases, particularly cancer, at early stages. This segment leverages the high sensitivity and accuracy of radiotracers to visualize and monitor the progress of diseases. Targeted diagnostic imaging is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of ongoing treatments and determining the optimal therapeutic approach. Radiopharmaceuticals in this segment are widely used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, which play a critical role in diagnosing a variety of conditions, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. In the Asia-Pacific region, increased healthcare investments and the growing demand for early disease detection have propelled the expansion of this market segment.</p><p><strong>Key Trends in the Asia-Pacific Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals Market:</strong></p><p>1.
