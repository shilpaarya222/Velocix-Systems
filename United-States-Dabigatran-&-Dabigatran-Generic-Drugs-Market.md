The primary applications include the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and the prevention of recurrence of these conditions. Dabigatran is also employed for secondary prevention in patients post-hip or knee replacement surgery.
