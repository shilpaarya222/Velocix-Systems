The material's ability to decompose without leaving harmful residues makes it a viable solution for businesses and consumers alike. Furthermore, the food and beverage industry, one of the largest consumers of disposable cups, is actively seeking alternatives to plastic to align with growing environmental consciousness and comply with evolving regulations. The growth of the quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector, along with innovations in cup design, material enhancement, and manufacturing processes, are expected to further fuel this market’s growth. The market is seeing a shift from conventional plastics and foam-based products to plant-based solutions. This transition is largely due to heightened concerns regarding plastic pollution and environmental sustainability. Starch-based cups offer a solution that not only helps reduce plastic waste but also promotes renewable and sustainable practices. The manufacturing cost of these cups has been steadily decreasing due to advancements in production technologies, making them increasingly competitive in terms of price against traditional disposable cups. A significant factor contributing to the growth of the disposable starch-based cup market is the increasing number of foodservice establishments, including cafes, fast food chains, and catering services, opting for eco-friendly packaging. Additionally, a rise in consumer preference for sustainable and eco-conscious products, especially among millennials and Generation Z, is also driving the adoption of biodegradable alternatives. The market’s expansion is also supported by favorable government regulations and policies, including bans on single-use plastics and incentives for using biodegradable packaging solutions.
